To send an email we have to import a plugin called Mailer.

1 - The line: "com.typesafe.play.plugins" %% "play-plugins-mailer" % "2.3.0" must be added at the libraryDependencies in the Build.sbt file of the project.
2 - A text file called play.plugins must be created at the conf folder.
3 - The line: 1500:com.typesafe.plugin.CommonsMailerPlugin must be added in the created file.
4 - Run the project. If it doesn't work, added the following to the build.sbt at the end of the document:

publishTo <<= (version) { version: String =>
  val nexus = "https://private-repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/"
  if (version.trim.endsWith("SNAPSHOT")) Some("snapshots" at nexus + "maven-snapshots/") 
  else                                   Some("releases"  at nexus + "maven-releases/")
}
 
javacOptions ++= Seq("-source", "1.6", "-target", "1.6", "-Xlint:unchecked", "-encoding", "UTF-8")

scalacOptions += "-deprecation"

After doing this close eclipse and go to next step.

5 - Eclipsiy again the project.
6 - Refresh the folder of the project in Eclipse.
7 - Set up the smtp. Go to application.conf file at conf directory in eclipse.
That's the configuration to set up gmail.
smtp.host=smtp.gmail.com
smtp.port=587
smtp.ssl=yes
smtp.user="raulperesgoes@gmail.com"
smtp.password="secret"

8 - Finally, set up the object to send the email. At the Result method in the Application.java

MailerAPI mail = play.Play.application().plugin(MailerPlugin.class).email();
    	mail.setSubject("mailer");
    	mail.setRecipient("raulperesgoes@gmail.com");
    	mail.setFrom("raulperesgoes@gmail.com");
    	
    	//sends text/text
    	mail.send( "Hello World! :)" );
